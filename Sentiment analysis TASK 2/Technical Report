Summary of Key Steps:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- Removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
- Text normalization via tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- Extracting special characters and removing non-alphanumeric characters.
- Sentiment Analysis Techniques:
VADER Sentiment Analysis: Calculates a sentiment score for each post.
- Classification: Labels posts as Positive, Neutral, or Negative based on the VADER score.
- Evaluation: Sentiment distribution is visualized using pie charts.
Modeling & Performance Evaluation:
- LSTM-based deep learning model setup using Keras.
- Data is tokenized and padded for input into the neural network.
- Performance measured through accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
Key Findings:
- Sentiment distribution: Positive (41.5%), Neutral (32.9%), Negative (25.5%).
- Preprocessing helps refine text for accurate sentiment classification.
- Visualization techniques (pie charts, word clouds) are used to communicate results.
